Description: The package contains all the functions necessary to run the DEECA FAME
            process of analysis of effects of a given fire history on environmental
            resilience metrics. These include Tolerable fire Inteval (TFI) status, area
            burned below TFI (BBTFI) and changes in relative abundance (RA) of fauna 
            species.It allows calcuation of all inter fire intervals and numbers of times
            an area has been burned by a given sequence of fires supplied as a shapefile.
            The FAME analysis can be run using standard R scripts, or alternatively via a
            shiny web GUI. The package does not contain the required input files (lookup
            tables, rasters of species HDMs etc) as these are too large to be loaded to 
            github and are available separately from an AWS repository.  The package is
            best used with the associated scripts and shiny app that can be cloned or 
            downloaded from https://github.com/nevilamos/FAMEshiny. The functions used 
            in the Growth Stage Optimisation are modified from code written by Paul
            Moloney (Arthur Rylah institute) and Holly Sitters (Melbourne University).
