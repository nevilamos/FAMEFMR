created by function fhProcess}

calc_U_AllCombs}

rasters to disk}

make_Spp_LU_list()}

\item{myResultsDir}{path of directory where results will be written usually
generated  by FAME script}

\item{myHDMVals}{matrix of cell values for Habitat Distribution Model rasters
for (at least) all TAXON_ID in myHDMSpp_NO generally provided in settings
file and read loaded by FAME script}

\item{myTaxonList}{data.frame of species attributes ( read from default or user
provided .csv)}

\item{writeYears}{vector for SEASONS for which rasters are to be written
otherwise if writeSpRasters == TRUE, if writeYears == NULL then all SEASONS
are written out}

\item{myWriteSp}{vector of TAXON_IDs provided if only subset of species rasters
are required as output.}
}
\value{
data frame wide format summary of relative abundance of species by SEASONS
}
\description{
Species' relative abundance calculation and summary
}
\details{
Calculates the relative abundance of species for each raster cell in
analysis and summaries these as summed abundance each season. Optionally it
also write relative abundance rasters for species to disk
}
